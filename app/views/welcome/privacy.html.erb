        <h2> Summary </h2>

        <p> We strive to be as clear as possible about how we use your data. When you sign up for an account, the information you use to register, and no more, is recorded. For one-time accounts, this means your andrew ID is stored. For users who register via Google, only your name is stored.  Unless required by law, your information will not be shared with third parties. The details of our privacy policy are outlined below. </p> <br> <br>

        <u> Chatrooms and User Submitted Content: </u>
        <p> Content submitted by any user is visible based on the context. </p>
